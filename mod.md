First, I would like to point out that this isn't a cheat mod. This mod removes a lot of the grinding and RNG from the game to make it more fair and less tedious. It allows for a normal playthrough without cheating but makes the game easier so you don't waste time or miss out on things due to unlucky RNG. There's still more changes that I'm planning to add to the mod when I have the time.

<br>

## Changelog:
- The stat increases from peeping on the girls in the morning while they shower is no longer decided by RNG. You now always get +1 Stealth and +1 Persuasion when you peep.
- If the mom catches you while you are peeping in the morning you don't lose influence anymore and don't get punished.
- A hint has been added to show where Alice hides her cigarettes in her room.
- Persuading Lisa that her homework is correct after you purposefully make a mistake will always succeed.
- If you hide a spider in Alice's bed at midnight she will now always see the spider and ask you to kill it instead of only seeing it sometimes.
- Alice always gives you $10 to kill a spider if you ask for money. (her mood still decreases)
- A few grammar and punctuation mistakes were corrected.

## Installation:
Just unzip the mod and put the "Data" folder from the mod in your Big Brother folder.
