## Changelog:
- The stat increases from peeping on the girls in the morning while they shower are no longer decided by RNG. You now always get +1 Stealth and +1 Persuasion when you peep.
- If the mom catches you while you are peeping in the morning you don't lose influence anymore.
- Persuading Lisa that her homework is correct after you purposefully make a mistake will always succeed.
- If you hide a spider in Alice's bed at midnight she now will always see the spider and ask you to kill it instead of only seeing it sometimes.
- Alice always gives you $10 to kill a spider if you ask for money. (her mood still gets lowered though)

## Installation:
Just unzip the mod and put the "Data" folder from the mod in your Big Brother folder.


This isn't a cheat mod, just removes a lot of the grinding and RNG.


Other:  
tells you where alice cigs are (probs dont need?)

a few grammar and punctuation corrections.
